# Tanks

A remake of the minigame "Tanks" from the 2006 game Wii Play by Nintendo.

## About

This is a small scale remake of the "Tanks!" minigame from the game Wii Play. Originally the goal of this project was to choose a small-scale game to remake as a way to learn how to develop networked multiplayer video games. The various parts of the project took longer than expected, so the netplay aspect has been indefinitely scrapped. What is finished is a fairly faithful, if crude, recreation of the original. Also featured is a cryptic (and buggy) level editor. Use at your own peril!

This game can only be played on Linux, though support for additional platforms could be added by any intrepid programmers out there if desired.

## Status

Mostly complete. Due to the unexpected length of development, the author decided to pursue other projects rather than put more time into this one. But who knows what the future will bring.

## Features

- Campaign from the original game
- Temp saves on window close
- Editor
- Simple 3D Graphics

## Issues

Due to limited time, there are many issues with this codebase that haven't been addressed:
- No support for platforms other than Linux (X11)
- No sprite batching for quads
- Poor collision handling
- Buggy editor with little in the way of visualization and no documentation.

## Credits

None of this would have been possible without the extensive analysis of the game documented by both TheGoldfishKing and BigKitty1011. Their work is incredibly impressive and quite thorough.
